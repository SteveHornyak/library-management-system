# library-management-system

This is a project based on designing a basic, yet functional, library management system. The purpose is to allow for a more streamlined version of how to run a library.

In this system, we have 2 interfaces: 1 for the librarian, where they are able to add/remove books from inventory, lookup locations of books within a library and also other functionalities. The second is the library patron, where they have access to check out a book, pay fines and also determine what they already have checked out.

# TO RUN
In order to run the program, one must have access to the g++ compiler. To run, navigate into the directory and then type "make all". From there, the program will compile ad be ready to start. TO start the program, type "./library" into the terminal.
